      <li>Catching half-deflated balls in mid-air</li>

    Ruby is always attentive to her surroundings.
    She wants to be involved in everything. She is easily
    jelous

  <p> 
    Sometimes, she is very annoying. I can't even kiss my girlfriend 
    with out her jumping on us, wanting to be involved.
    I swear she gets jelous of the attention my girlfriend gets?
